I'm a software developer from Sri Lanka.

[![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Rahal-Kanishka&hide_rank=true)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I'm pretty handy with building end to end enterprise web applications. I'm experienced with Java, Python, Angular and MySql. Add to that I'm a certified Assosciate Solutions Architect for Amazon Web Services.

My recent focus is on Machine learning . And I'm reading for a Master's Degree at University of Towson Maryland. Had an awesome time learning and practising machine learning concepts so far. But I would appreciate any kind of guidance to focus my attention.
